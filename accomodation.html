The hotel where we are staying is the <a

to stay there, do let us know as we will be organising some group taxis to and
from here.

Other recommended areas not too far from the venue and near tube stations are
Vauxhall, Waterloo and Tower Bridge. There are premier inns, travelodges and
similar in these areas. Please give one of us an email or call if you want some
