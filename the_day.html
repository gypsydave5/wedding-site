On the day, the ceremony will start promptly at <strong>4pm</strong>. We suggest that you arrive
from <strong>3:30pm</strong> so you are ready and seated by 4pm.

<p>
The ceremony will last approximately 20 minutes and be followed by a champagne
reception.
</p>

At 6pm we will move to the reception venue, where dinner will be served around
7pm.
</p>

Following dinner will be speeches, cake and a DJ. The celebrations will
finish upstairs at midnight. However, the downstairs part of the pub is open
until 1am should you wish to make the evening last a touch longer!
