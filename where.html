<h2>Ceremony</h2>

<p>We're getting married at <a href="http://asylumlondon.org/">The Asylum</a>, a deconsecrated chapel turned arts venue:</p>

<address>
Caroline Gardens Chapel</br>
Asylum Road</br>

</address>

<h4>
Public transport
</h4>

<p>
The nearest station is Queens Road Peckham. This station is served by Southern
Trains (out of London Bridge) and London Overground (the line between Clapham
Junction and Highbury & Islington). The venue is about a 5-10 walk from the
station down Asylum Road. There are also a number of buses which serve the area.
</p>

<h4>By car</h4>

<p>
The venue has no specific parking, so we recommend public transport where
possible. However there is some on street parking in the area.
</p>

<h2>Reception</h2>

<p>We'll be having food and drinks at <a href="http://eastdulwichtavern.com/">The East Dulwich Tavern</a> afterwards:</p>

<p>The reception room is upstairs in the pub through the entrance to the right of
the main entrance.</p>

<h4>Public transport</h4>
<p>The nearest station is East Dulwich which is served by Southern Trains out of
London Bridge. The venue is about a five minute walk. The final train from East
Dulwich is at around 23:30. After that, the area is served by night buses.
Alternatively you can book a taxi â€“ large London firms include Addison Lee,
Green Tomatos and Uber.</p>

<h4>By car</h4>

<p>Again, there is no designated parking, so we recommend public transport. However
there is some on street parking in the area.</p>
